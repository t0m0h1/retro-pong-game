# retro-pong-game
Pong style game using the turtle module to draw objects:


brief:

I decided to build a retro style game which opens in a small window, which would be simple in nature.


the idea is to use this as a base iteration for further pong projects, or indeed, other games using pygame, turtle, and other modules.


further iterations may include collision sounds, startup sounds, and events such as mini games or actions.

remember, the game is based on a single player paddle and ball game, so there is not much scope for further development, but feel free to use this as you will!
